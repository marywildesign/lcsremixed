        for permission to work with Douglas Davis’ <em>The World’s Longest Collaborative Sentence</em>
        (1994–2012).
      </p>
      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        <em>longest collaborative sentence [remixed]</em> emerged from an MA Experiments course
        exploring ways of expanding Guttorm Nordø’s mail art publication <em>El Djarida</em>.
        The project shifts this investigation into the digital realm, using Douglas Davis’
        internet-based collaborative artwork as a point of departure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Davis’ sentence—open, anonymous, and unmoderated—offers an early and revealing example
        of digital freedom of expression. Its accumulation of voices exposes the tension between
        openness and harm, raising questions about where responsibility lies when collective authorship
        is left unchecked.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website presents the original sentence as a continuously autoscrolling text,
        transforming it into a typographic environment rather than a fixed document.
        Multiple censorship modes allow readers to choose how the text is obscured,
        while never revealing the censored words themselves. In doing so, the project
        shifts the act of moderation from platform to user, creating a paradox in which
        censorship is both participatory and invisible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some methods of obscuring language are intentionally disruptive, introducing friction
        and visual noise, while others remain subtle and ambient. This spectrum reflects the
        varied approaches to moderation found in digital communities—from heavy-handed suppression
        to nuanced content management—and asks how each shapes participation, responsibility,
        and collective authorship.
      </p>
      <h3>Design & Implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The text autoscrolls to evoke continuity and flow, contrasting the finite, physical nature
        of mail art publications. Source material was collected via Python-based web scraping,
        conducted with permission, to preserve the integrity of the original work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Censorship decisions were informed by close reading of the sentence, accounting not only
        for explicit language but also for subtler forms of aggression. Accessibility and reading
        patterns were considered throughout, particularly in the design of the obscuring methods.
