      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>
        <em>longest collaborative sentence [remixed]</em> uses Douglas Davis’
        internet-based collaborative artwork as a foundation for exploring the 
        friction between authorship and censorship. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Davis’ sentence, which is open, anonymous, and unmoderated, offers an early and revealing example
        of freedom of expression in a digital space. The accumulation of voices exposes the tension between
        free speech and hate speech, raising questions about where responsibility lies when collective authorship
        is left unchecked.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website presents the original sentence as a continuously autoscrolling text, with
        a larger focus on the typographic environment, rather than a fixed document.
        Multiple censorship modes allow readers to choose how the text is obscured,
        while aiming to never revealing the censored words themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some methods of obscuring language is intentionally disruptive, introducing friction
        and visual noise, while others are meant to remain subtle. This spectrum reflects the
        varied approaches to moderation found in digital communities, calling into question
        how this shapes participation, responsibility, and collective authorship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Censorship decisions were informed by close reading of the sentence, accounting not only
        for explicit language but also for subtler forms of aggression. Accessibility and reading
        patterns were considered throughout, particularly in the design of the obscuring methods. 
        Naturally, some words and nuance could have gone unnoticed. If this is the case, please
